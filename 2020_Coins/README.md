These coins are laser etched with various Attrition graphics. Around 50 full sets were 
made based on available materials on hand. Additional coins were made but not a full 
set, so they were put in small ziplock bags with the "Lolzo" image (made by y3t1), to 
be knock-offs of the original. Ten months later some remain available in future charity
auctions.
